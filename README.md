# firefox-ibkr-spread-indicator

A Firefox extension for IBKR that calculates and displays the real-time spread difference between the ask and bid prices, showing both the absolute value and percentage.

This extension was declined by the Mozilla Add-ons Store because it is intended for a limited audience (IBKR users). However, you can still download and install it manually.

## How to Install
1. Navigate to the latest signed `.xpi` file on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mhabala/firefox-ibkr-spread-indicator/releases) page.
2. If you are using Firefox, you will see a prompt:  
   *"Allow github.com to install an add-on?"*  
   Click **"Continue to Installation"**, then click **"Add"** to confirm.


## Updates
Since this add-on is **self-hosted**, it will not receive automatic updates from Mozilla. To update to a newer version:
1. Check for the latest release on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mhabala/firefox-ibkr-spread-indicator/releases) page.
2. Download and install the new `.xpi` file following the steps in the **How to Install** section.
